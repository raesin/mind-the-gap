Mind the Gap
============

*Mind the Gap* is an interactive, responsive slideshow built with HTML, CSS3 animations, and JQuery.

The purpose of the slider was to detail the widening poverty gap between Londoners while also displaying different user stories at each selected Tube stop. The design, built in Illustrator, mimicks the iconic London Tube map while also showcasing some simple animations as if you were viewing an interactive map! 

At the end of development the interactive slider was placed onto [Marketplace's](http://www.marketplace.org) site (built off of Drupal).
